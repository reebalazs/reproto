# Reproto - Protocol Buffer support for Rescript

## @reproto/bs-protobuf

Protocol Buffer support for Rescript

Uses protobufjs/protobuf.js of dcodeIO and Contributors under the hood. Rescript types are autogenerated.

Support for Proto 2 and Proto 3.

Message encoding and decoding support. Provides a completely type safe protobuf message implementation with (almost)
immutable data structures.

Services support that allows for GRPC implementation via any custom rpcImpl. - Note: I have no interest to,
and will not work on implementing grpc-web, but it could be done and the library is able to support it.

GRPC stream support ready.

## @reproto/proto-demo

A working React client + Express server example that implements non-streaming GRPC (Not grpc-web).

## Roadmap

Status: Work in progress. Planned next:

- Cleanup. Repo structure and tooling is in flux now.
- Documentation
- Add missing proto field types
- First production ready release planned for **END OF SEPTEMBER 2021**

Stay tuned!
