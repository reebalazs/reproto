# Reproto - Protocol Buffer support for Rescript

## @reproto/bs-protobuf

Protocol Buffer support for Rescript

Uses protobufjs/protobuf.js of dcodeIO and Contributors internally.
Rescript types are autogenerated.

Supports both Proto 2 and Proto 3.

Message encoding and decoding support. Provides a completely type safe
protobuf message implementation with (almost)
immutable data structures.

Services support that allows for GRPC implementation via any custom rpcImpl.
An example rpcImpl provided, implementing non-streaming GRPC with
Axios, working both in browsers and on node.

Note: I have no interest to,
and will not work on implementing grpc-web, but it could be done as a
separate package.

GRPC stream support ready.

## @reproto/proto-demo

A working React client + Express server example that implements
non-streaming GRPC (Not grpc-web).

## Roadmap

Status: Work in progress. Planned next:

- Documentation
- Add missing proto field types
- First production ready release planned for **END OF SEPTEMBER 2021**

Stay tuned!
