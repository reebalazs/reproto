Reproto: Protocol Buffer support for Rescript

## Scope

Uses protobufjs/protobuf.js of dcodeIO and Contributors internally.
Rescript types are autogenerated.

Supports both Proto 2 and Proto 3.

Message encoding and decoding support. Provides a completely type safe
protobuf message implementation with fully immutable data structures.

Services support that allows for GRPC implementation via any custom rpcImpl.

Note: I have no interest in implementing grpc-web, but it could be done as a
separate package.

GRPC stream support ready.

## Data model

The implementation uses the `protobufjs` library, which
is a pure JavaScript implementation, for encoding the messages. On the top of this
JavaScript implementation, Rescript data types are generated from the proto definitions.
